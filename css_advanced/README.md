SmileSchool: Advanced CSS Styling

This project is the second phase of the SmileSchool web development series, focusing on applying advanced CSS techniques to bring a static HTML structure to life. The primary objective is to style a webpage for a fictional school, "SmileSchool," according to a professional design provided on Figma.

This project involves a deep dive into CSS fundamentals, including selectors, specificity, the box model, and responsive design, without the use of any external CSS frameworks or libraries. The base HTML is provided from the HTML, advanced project.
